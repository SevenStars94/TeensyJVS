# TeensyJVS
Jamma Video Standard (JVS) IO board implemented using a Teensy 3.1

Quick and dirty implementation of the JVS IO standard (http://superusr.free.fr/arcade/JVS/JVST_VER3.pdf) for adding controls to a SEGA NAOMI (and other JVS compatible boards) without having to shell out for an official IO board.

Intended to be compiled for the Teensy 3.1 in the Arduino IDE. The comments at the top of the file have the schematic draw in ASCII art.
